As a result, there is a rapidly growing body of work emerging in this domain. We hope to categorize and synergize recent efforts to provide a comprehensive guidebook of social agents weaving together multiple domains, including language, embodiment, and robotics. </p> <p>Our goal is to offer insights crucial for understanding and harnessing social agents' potential impact on society. We strive to keep these updated regularly and continuously. We greatly appreciate any contributions via PRs, issues, emails, or other methods.</p> <p>Note</p> <ul> <li>Agent and Environment (Sutton and Barto 2018): An agent is a goal-driven decision-maker that sense and act upon the state of the environment. An environment comprises the state outside the agent, including the other agents if any. </li> <li>Social Agent: An agent that interacts with a multi-agent environment.</li> <li>Socially Intelligent Agent: A social agent that interacts and communicates with other agents in a human-interpretable way. more notes<ol> <li>The social intelligence that we are focusing on is human-like, excluding the collective intelligence in a lot of social animals like ants, bees, fishes. </li> <li>To understand whether an entity is a (social) agent, we have to situate it in an environment. It is not possible to discuss an agent outside of an environment. </li> <li>We acknowledge there are many types of definitions for social agents. Our defitions here help narrow down the scope of our survey.</li> <p>\ud83d\uddc2\ufe0f Check out the examples of social agents. \ud83d\udcda Check out the table format of the collected papers here.</p> <p>\ud83d\udcdd We are currently working on a survey paper related to content of this repository.
